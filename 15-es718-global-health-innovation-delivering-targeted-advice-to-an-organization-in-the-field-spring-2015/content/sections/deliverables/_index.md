Brief Reviews
-------------

On the first day, students completed web and literature research on issues in child development, mental health, and chronic disease in India. They were assigned a particular set of resources to study in pairs, and prepared a three-bullet review assignment:

*   What's the particular resource about, in a nutshell?
*   What is really great / interesting / valuable?
*   What is missing?
